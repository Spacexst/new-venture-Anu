Polymorphism is an object-oriented programming concept that refers to the ability of a variable ,function or an object to take multiple forms(Source:techopedia.com)
In a programming language that exhibits Polymorphism,objects of classes belonging to the same heirarchy tree(inherited from a common base class)may posses functions bearing the same name but each having different behaviours.
The term was originally used by evolutionary biologists to refer to the occurance of two or more clearly different forms also referred to as phenotypes in the population of a species.To be classified as such ,the phenotypes must occupy the same habitat at the same time and belong to a panmictic population(Wikipedia)
